In Solidity, unchecked external calls refer to situations where a contract interacts with another contract without properly validating and handling potential exceptions or errors. This can lead to various security risks, including reentrancy attacks and unexpected behavior 1.

An example of an unchecked external call can be seen in the following Solidity code:

In this contract, the withdrawAll function allows the owner to withdraw all the funds from the contract. However, this function does not check whether the owner address is a contract or not before sending the funds. If the owner is a malicious contract, it could have a fallback function that calls withdrawAll again, leading to a reentrancy attack.
